I aim to make a simple yet effective design for this website 

the JavaScript Interaction I implement is pretty simple and straightforward . 

1) When user click the Campaign Form it will redirect the user to the form ( they can scroll but I want to make it fancy like that )
2) When user fill out the form , they press submit and their data will be saved into the console ( dev tools ) 
3) If they press submit when they haven't fill out the form , a message will popup saying they need to fill out the form first before submitting ( if else statement )

I use a lot of reference in making this simple website ( most of it are from slides, youtube and w3school )
